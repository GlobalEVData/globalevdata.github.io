The data were sourced from Amap and include the longitude and latitude of each station. Non-public EVCS, battery swap stations or irrelevant charging stations such as mobile-phone charging stations were excluded through keyword-based filtering. Over this 11-year period, the number of stations increased from 1,832 at the end of 2014 to 271,802 stations by the middle of 2025.
