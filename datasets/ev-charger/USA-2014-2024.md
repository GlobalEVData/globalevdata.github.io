## 1. Data Description

The data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC) and include the longitude and latitude of each station, as well as the number of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) (or chargers) by type: Direct Current (DC) fast charging, and Alternating Current (AC) Level 1 and Level 2. DC fast chargers, AC Level 2, and AC Level 1 provide different output powers, typically ranging from 50–350 kW, 7–19 kW, and about 1 kW, respectively. We extracted data for December 31st of each year from 2014 to 2024. Over this 11-year period, the number of stations increased from 9,094 stations with 22,217 chargers at the end of 2014 to 69,593 stations with 195,693 chargers by the end of 2024.
