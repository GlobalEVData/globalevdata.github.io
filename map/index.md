## [Spatial Distribution of EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) in 2022](./AB.md)
> The spatial distribution of public EVCSs across China, the United States, and Europe in 2022. It is found that the distribution of EVCSs in China and Europe exhibits significant concentration, with approximately 50% located in specific city clusters in China and 80% in Europe. Meanwhile, this concentration is less pronounced but still significant in the US, at around 20%. The substantial clustering of EVCSs in prominent city clusters (often characterized by higher levels of economic activity and development) underscores the spatial inequities in EVCS deployment, leaving less-developed areas potentially underserved. Note that 50% of EVCS locations are used here in order to generate the map quickly while keeping the key spatial EVCS patterns.

  ## [Population Coverage of Public EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) in 2022](./C.md)

  > The spatial distributions of the level of population coverage of EVCSs at the city level across China, the US, and Europe. It can be found that for most cities in the our study areas, they tend to have a low level of population coverage of EVCSs.

  ## [Housing Price around Public EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) in 2022](./D.md)

  > The spatial distributions of the housing price index of EVCSs at the city level across China and the US with different buffer radii. It can be found that for most cities in both China and the US, the values of housing price index are close to each other (fluctuating around 1), while the US has a wider variation range.

  ## [The Built Environment around Public EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) in 2022](./E.md)

  > The spatial distributions of POI Mix of EVCSs at the city level across China, the US, and Europe with different buffer radii. It can be found that for most cities in our study areas, they tend to have a high POI Mix of EVCSs, while more cities in the US and Europe tend to have a higher POI Mix of EVCSs compared to China when the buffer radii are 800m and 1000m.

  ## [Access to Public EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) through Road Network in 2022](./F.md)

  > The spatial distributions of road network density and the relative development level of road network around EVCSs at the city level across China, the US, and Europe with different buffer radii. It can be found that road network density around EVCSs in Chinese cities tend to be lower compared to the US and Europe. Meanwhile, in terms of the relative development level of road network, cities in China and the US tend to have a greater variability compared to Europe.
